# Retargeter


the upcoming blender addon 'retargeter' is currently in development.

Whats currently possible:
- importing face mesh from android as empties
- importing blend shapes from ios to animate shape keys
- importing motion of the device camera
- importing dot cloud

Whats planned:
- many ui features
    - especially blend shape import ui
- generated rig driven by face mesh

you can download it, and may import .json data received by the mobile app "retargeter" (which is also currently in development)


the imported .json data can be used in anyway. However you aren't allowed to sell or modifiy the add-on / source code. If you want to contribute or join the development - let me know. Yet this isn't possible as I'm writing this toolset as part of my thesis.
